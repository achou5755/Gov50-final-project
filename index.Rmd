## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the healthcare industry. For example, I would be curious to learn more about trends on non-profit vs for-profit hospitals over the years, or the number of physicians (and specialists) in the US military. It would also be interesting to investigate access to healthcare: has the number of hospitals in rural regions increased?
